&gt;<br>
&gt; A closure is an object that supports exactly one method: &quot;apply&quot;.</p>
<p>That's true from one perspective, and was what I was thinking of related to<br>
objects being used as hacks to work around lack of closures.  A closure's<br>
simplicity can be an asset: classes and interfaces can get in the way of<br>
simple parameterization of behavior.  Anyone who's tried functional<br>
programming in Java or C++ has encountered this - it can be done, but it's<br>
more tedious.  If all you want to do is e.g. (map somefun mylist), being<br>
able to concisely define executable &quot;objects&quot; (closures), inline if<br>
necessary, is very useful.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, the apply &quot;method&quot; of a closure can be used as<br>
a low-level method dispatch mechanism, so closures can be, and are, used to<br>
implement very effective objects with multiple methods.  Oleg Kiselyov has a<br>
short article on the subject:<br>
<u>http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/oop-in-fp.txt</u></p>
<p>Used in this way, closures can be said to be richer than objects because<br>
they can support many more capabilities than just a single language-provided<br>
method dispatch mechanism.  With closures seen as a building block with<br>
which to implement objects, it's clear that objects are a poor man's<br>
closures.</p>
<p>But a Smalltalker might say hold on, if you're going to all the trouble to<br>
implement these closure thingies in your language, since they're already a<br>
lot like objects, why not go all the way and make them &quot;real&quot; objects that<br>
can support an arbitrary number of methods, so that a closure is just one<br>
special-case kind of object?  If your language only has these restricted<br>
closures, and you're forced to build an object system on top of them, it's<br>
clear that closures are a poor man's objects.</p>
<p>Given this tension between opposites, I maintain that the question of<br>
closures vs. objects should really be a koan.  I'll take some koanic license<br>
and combine Norman Adams (alleged source of &quot;objects are a poor man's<br>
closures&quot;) and Christian Queinnec (&quot;closures are a poor man's objects&quot;) into<br>
a single great Zen language master named Qc Na.  I'll also take the<br>
un-humble step of inserting myself as student, since as I mentioned in the<br>
last paragraph of this message:<br>
<u>http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01488.html</u></p>
<p>...I believe I did in fact gain some enlightenment from considering these<br>
two apparently opposing positions.  Here goes:</p>
<p>  The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton.  Hoping to<br>
prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said &quot;Master, I have heard that<br>
objects are a very good thing - is this true?&quot;  Qc Na looked pityingly at<br>
his student and replied, &quot;Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's<br>
closures.&quot;</p>
<p>  Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell,<br>
intent on studying closures.  He carefully read the entire &quot;Lambda: The<br>
Ultimate...&quot; series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small<br>
Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system.  He learned much, and<br>
looked forward to informing his master of his progress.</p>
<p>  On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by<br>
saying &quot;Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand<br>
that objects are truly a poor man's closures.&quot;  Qc Na responded by hitting<br>
Anton with his stick, saying &quot;When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's<br>
object.&quot;  At that moment, Anton became enlightened.</p>
